    <h1>PeaceColor Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last updated: 2026-01-20</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how PeaceColor (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) handles information when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>PeaceColor is currently a standalone app and does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. No user information is transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <p>We may collect non-personal information such as app performance or crash logs in future updates. If we introduce any data collection, we will clearly notify users and update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Since PeaceColor currently does not collect personal data, we do not use or process user information.</p>

    <p>If data collection is added in the future, it will be used only to improve app functionality, user experience, and app stability.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>PeaceColor does not currently integrate any third-party analytics or tracking services.</p>

    <p>If we integrate any third-party services in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and clearly disclose what data is collected and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take user privacy seriously. Since the app currently does not collect any personal data, there is no user data stored or transmitted.</p>

    <p>If we add data collection in the future, we will take appropriate security measures to protect user information.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with a revised “Last updated” date.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:tkr_1203@outlook.com">tkr_1203@outlook.com</a></p>
